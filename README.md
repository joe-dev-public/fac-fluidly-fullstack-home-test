# Fluidly home test

[assert-equals.js](https://github.com/joe-dev-public/fac-fluidly-fullstack-home-test/blob/main/assert-equals.js) contains the assertEquals function I wrote in response to this challenge.

[assert-equals.spec.js](https://github.com/joe-dev-public/fac-fluidly-fullstack-home-test/blob/main/assert-equals.spec.js) contains the example test that was provided, and the additional tests that I wrote.

I kept setup and coding time strictly within an hour! ðŸ™‚

I've been using ``npx jest`` to run the tests in my local environment.

Screenshot below shows all the tests I wrote passing:
